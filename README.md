# SeasonSense-Expansion
This is an extension of the plugin PlaceholderAPI (PAPI) that allows you to show the season we are in. The names of the seasons are configurable and the season we are in is calculated using Time4J project that has a precision that is for modern times (around 2000) better than a minute.

# Placeholders
%seasonsense_season% - the season of the year we are in.
